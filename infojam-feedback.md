######Filter NewsFeed
1. Does clicking the Strategies / Markets / Themes filter the news feed? YES, IT SHOULD DO. WE NEED TO  WORK OUT HOW IT DOES THIS AND HOW IT REVERTS BACK TO DEFAULT OF NO FILTERS. 
2. If so we need to have check boxes to allow multiple filters. YES
3. Also these checkboxes need to be pre populated from the users profile.NOT SURE ABOUT THIS, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE OT SELECT MULTIPLE THEMES IN THEIR PROFILE, BUT ALSO SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD NEW THEMES AS THEY GO TOO. 

######Themes
1. We need to decide if these are going to be manually added on a periodic (hourly / daily / weekly) basis or automated from the posts.IT WILL HAVE TO BE AUTOMATED. AS USERS MAY WISH TO ADD MULTPLE AS YET UNDEFINED OR THERE MAYBE AN EVENT WHICH USERS REACT TOO LIKE TERROR ATTACK OR EARNINGS RESULTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
2. If automation we need to decide on the algo. CAN DISCUSS I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE

######Trending
1. As Themes

######Feed
1. This needs to update in realtime. NOT EXACTLY REAL TIME BUT CLOSE TO IT...
2. We need to determine what specifys the order (relevance, date etc etc)THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH. ITS VERY EASY WHEN THERE ARE A HANDFUL OR THEMES (SAY 5) AND A HANDFUL OF USERS TRACKING THOSE THEMES. RMEMEBER THAT EVERYONE CAN COMMENT OR POST ON A THEME, IF THERE ARE 10K USERS ALL TALKING ABOUT CHINA AND YOU, AS A USER ARE FOLLWING THE CHINA THEME YOU NEWSFEED WILL WIZZZZ BY AS UPDATES COME IN. 
3. Are we happy going with the facebook esque Like WHAT IS THAT?
4. What / How / when / Who and Why are we sharing. SHARING IS SOMETHING I AM GRAPPLING WITH. ITS TRICKY BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF WHO CAN SE WHAT AND WHO CANNOT. PERHAPS SHARING SHOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED ON PUBLIC POSTS. IT JUST DOESNT WORK OTHERWISE BECAUSE A HFM'S STUFF (IF NON-PUBLIC) WILL ONLY BE VISABLE TO INVESTORS. IF THEY SHARE IT, THEIR POSTS ARE ONLY VISIBLE TO HFM'S. SO THEM SHARING IT WOULDNT BE VISIBLE TO ANYTONE... YOU GET ME? 
5. What dictates what comments we see (Can we see comments from people we are not connected to?) FEW LAYERS ON COMMENTS TO CONSIDER. IF YOU COMMENT ON SOMETHING YOU SOUD BE ALLOWED TO COMMENT WITH VISIBILITY. I.E. PPL WILL SEE YOUR COMPANY NAME AND TYPE (HFM OR INVESTOR). OR YOU CAN COMMENT ANONYMOUSLY BUT THAT COMMENT WILL STILL DISPLAY WHAT TYPE YOUR ARE HFM OR INVESTOR AND YOUR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. PERHAPS THE WAY TO DEAL WITH WHO CAN SEE COMMENTS OR NOT IS TO MAKE ALL VISIBLE, BUT IF YOU ARE NOT A CONNECTION YOU CANNOT SEE WO MADE THE COMMENT ONLY THE "TYPE AND LOCAITON" INFO IS VISIBLE. 

######Top Right Hamburger
1. Why? - FAIR QUESTION NOT SURE ALTHO PROBABLY WORTH KEEPING IN CASE IT IS USED LATER. COULD BE A USEFUL WAY TO NAVIGATE AWAY FROM THE 4 MAIN PAGES. LIKE OT GET SUPPORT OR WHATEVER. 

#####Logic
1. Exactly what determines what posts I can see. THIS IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE STANDARD LINKEDIN. DEFAULT SETTINGS SHOULD BE, FUNDS CANT SE EOTHER FUNDS STUFF AND THE SAME FOR ALLOCATORS SEEING OTHER ALLOCATORS POSTS. HOWEVER, IT MAY VARY ON THE TYPE OF POST 
2. Can a fund see other funds posts.NO
3. Can an alocator see other alocators funds.NO
4. Feed.2 ?????

######Left and right filters
1. How will we transition back to news feed if the filters on the left and right are selected.PERHAPS A "REMOVE FILTERS" BUTTON 

######Main image
1. I cant imagine to many people adding htere own cover image as this would be a company relevant image. So for those that havent we need ot have an automated unique image. We could do some cool autgenerated pattern similar to google+ YEAH FAIR POINT ALTHO I THINK FUNDS WILL ADD COVERS MORE THAN U THINK. 
2. Will we show this on mobile? NOPE
3. We will probably need some manual intervention for removing in appropriate images. LIKE BOOBS? I GUESS BUT ALSO CANT IMAGINE A BUSINESS WILL BLOW THEMSELVE SUP BY POSTING SOMETHIGN IN APROPRIATE ALTOH MAYBE A DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE

######Company Profile
1. Will this be a finite list of data items or will we be adding new data items via an admin panel. FINITE TO START BUT WITH FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE COULD ADD
2. What is behind the view more? NOTHING ACTUALLY. SHOULD BE REMOVED. 


#####Logic
1. Can we have more than 1 user per fund updating this info? If so do we need a process of confirmation from other users in the fund?
YES, THIS IS ONE OF MY BIG HEADACHES. i CANT WORK OUT HOW THIS SHOULD WORK. ITS EASY AT A  SMALL FUND WHERE 1 GUY CALLS THE SHOTS, BUT ITS LESS CLEAR AT BIGGER PLACES WHERE MULTIPLE PEOPLE MAY UPDATE AND ACCESS THE PROFILE. I WONDER IF WE SHOULDNT HAVE SUBACCOUNT LOG INS WITH PERMISSIONS AS TO WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT UPDATE....

######Block
1. Can we interact with people we are not conncected to? NOPE. YOU CAN LIKE, SHARE AND COMMENT ON PUBLIC POSTS, HOWEVER, YOU CANT MSG SOMEONE WIHTOUT BEING A CONNECTION. YOU CAN SEND A REQUEST FOR CONNETION AND THATS IT. 
2. If so do we just un follow instead of block? POSSIBLY. ALTHO NICE TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT SOMEONE SEEING EVERYTHING OF YOURS, EVEN IF IT IS PUBLIC. MAYBE USERS WOULD LIKE THE SECURITY OF KNOWHING CERTAIN PPL ARE BLOCKED FROM SEEING THEM ON THE PLATFROM ENTIRELY. 
3. Will we need the functionality to update / change message text from the admin panel? YES



#####Logic
1. Does the user get notified they have been blocked? NO. I THINK THEY CAN JUST NO LONGER SEE THE OTHER USER AS IF THE BLOCKER IS NO LONGER ON THE PLATFROM.

#####Logic
1. Where is this infomation surfaced? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
2. Does somebody need to reveiw this infomation? IF YOU MEAN PENIDNG
3. If it is not used should we be storing it? WE SHOULD TRY TO STORE EVERYTHING. THE MORE WE STORE THE MORE VALUE WE CREATE IF THE WHOLE THINK GOES BELLY UP.
