######Filter NewsFeed
1. Does clicking the Strategies / Markets / Themes filter the news feed? 
2. If so we need to have check boxes to allow multiple filters.
3. Also these checkboxes need to be pre populated from the users profile.

######Themes
1. We need to decide if these are going to be manually added on a periodic (hourly / daily / weekly) basis or automated from the posts.
2. If automation we need to decide on the algo.

######Trending
1. As Themes

######Feed
1. This needs to update in realtime.
2. We need to determine what specifys the order (relevance, date etc etc)
3. Are we happy going with the facebook esque Like
4. What / How / when / Who and Why are we sharing.
5. What dictates what comments we see (Can we see comments from people we are not connected to?)

######Top Right Hamburger
1. Why?

#####Logic
1. Exactly what determines what posts I can see
2. Can a fund see other funds posts.
3. Can an alocator see other alocators funds.
4. Feed.2

######Left and right filters
1. How will we transition back to news feed if the filters on the left and right are selected.

######Main image
1. I cant imagine to many people adding htere own cover image as this would be a company relevant image. So for those that havent we need ot have an automated unique image. We could do some cool autgenerated pattern similar to google+
2. Will we show this on mobile?
3. We will probably need some manual intervention for removing in appropriate images.

######Company Profile
1. Will this be a finite list of data items or will we be adding new data items via an admin panel.
2. What is behind the view more?


#####Logic
1. Can we have more than 1 user per fund updating this info? If so do we need a process of confirmation from other users in the fund?
